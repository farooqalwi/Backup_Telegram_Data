However, some functionality and features have been presented differently for ease of use and student activity tracking. Like any new version of a software some features are liked by users and others take time getting used to. **The ICT teams are actively looking into any complaints and evaluating feedback in order to make it even better and more functional.\n**\nAt the same time, unfortunately, **some miscreants started generating severe BruteForce and DDoS cyber-attacks on LMS to make it inaccessible **for obvious reasons. The ICT teams are continuously taking measures to mitigate these attacks on our websites and will not rest till the issue is resolved. We regret the inconvenience caused and appreciate your patience.\n\nThe University authorities have identified these sources and gathered the requisite information, which is now being sent to FIA Cyber Crimes wing for further action against these culprits.\n\nFurthermore, to compensate students with their graded activities the university extended the deadlines for different graded activities as deemed appropriate, so that students could make their submissions.\n\nhttps://www.vu.edu.pk/NewsDetails.aspx?type=&NewsId=4369"

The apprehensions of students were reviewed carefully in consultation with the Vice Chancellors of all the provinces and regions, keeping in view the difficulties brought about by the pandemic and opening of universities from February 01, 2021.\n\nHEC Guidance on Assessment and Examinations is available at the link https://www.hec.gov.pk/english/HECAnnouncements/Documents/nCoVirus/Assessments-Examinations.pdf. \n\nIn this policy, HEC already allowed universities to use their **discretion** to conduct exams, either on-campus or online as long as the chosen mode provides a fair assessment of students' performance. Universities should take stock of their \"exam readiness\", i.e., technological readiness, managerial capacity, and the announced policy, and choose the best possible mode of assessment. \n\nOnline exams either can be used if the universities administer 'Open Book Exams' or establish an invigilation system in a supervised environment. In this mode, universities will also have to use Turnitin to check similarity index with Web and the answers of other students. Further, viva/oral exam may be integrated in the assessment where necessary.\n\nOn-campus exams can be used only under strict compliance with all Covid-19 health and safety protocols. Universities may also have to organize make-up classes for two weeks in case students consider the course coverage to be deficient. Assessment of all courses requiring psychomotor skills, such as medicine, engineering, subjects involving lab/studio work must be held on campus.\n\nAll students in a single course will be examined in the same mode i.e., either on-line or on-campus.\n\nhttps://hec.gov.pk/english/news/news/Pages/Fair-Assessment.aspx"
